Maze Generator in Python

Purpose/Description:
This is an application that will generate a x by y maze (where x and y are user-specified values, x, y > 5)
The purpose of the application is mostly for fun, but could potentially be used for adjacent programs that
make use of a path-finding algorithm (potentially dijkstra's algorithm) that requires a PASS/FAIL test in order
to be tested.

Concept:
Walls fall between squares that make up the grid of the maze;
From each point on the grid-- it can have a wall going up, down, left, or right. (the points are at the overlap
of x and y lines.


Implementation:
1. first we need to take in user input for a maze
2. construct a dynamic vector which has the desired dimensions
3. randomly assign walls


Requirements:
the maze needs to be solvable (how to prove)
the maze needs to be displayed in a visual format
